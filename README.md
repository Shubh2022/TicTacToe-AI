# TicTacToe-AI
A program where you play against a AI in tictactoe.

The runner.py program was provided by by CS50's Introduction to Artificial Intelligence with python course on edX. 

runner.py contains most of front end programming while tictactoe.py contains most of the logic, including the AI.

All of the function definitions in tictactoe.py was implemented by me.

The AI will never lose, the game will either end in a tie or a loss for the user.

The .ttf file is for font in the GUI

To use the program you just need to run runner.py.
